# FallingRocks

## Description
The game is very intuitive but also very challenging. The player is situated at the bottom of the window. The main goal of the game is to avoid the falling rocks by moving the player left or right using the arrows on the keyboard. The rocks are in different colors and shapes and after every level they speed up so the player has to be more careful. The game ends when a rock hits the player.
